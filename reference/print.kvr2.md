# Print Methods for r2 and comp_fit calculation Objects

Printing objects of class "`r2_kvr2`" (generated by
[`r2()`](https://indenkun.github.io/kvr2/reference/r2_kvr2.md)) or
"`comp_kvr2`" (generated by
[`comp_fit()`](https://indenkun.github.io/kvr2/reference/comp_kvr2.md)),
respectively, by simple print methods.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'r2_kvr2'
print(x, ..., digits = 4)

# S3 method for class 'comp_kvr2'
print(x, ..., digits = 4)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  AN object of class "`r2_kvr2`" or "`comp_kvr2`".

- ...:

  Further arguments passed to or from other methods.

- digits:

  The number of significant digits to be used for printing. Default to
  4.

## Value

The input object is returned invisibly (via `invisible(x)`). This
function is called for its side effect of printing the results of
[`r2()`](https://indenkun.github.io/kvr2/reference/r2_kvr2.md) or
[`comp_fit()`](https://indenkun.github.io/kvr2/reference/comp_kvr2.md)
calculations to the console.

## Details

These methods format the calculated statistics into a human-readable
summary, displaying each index or metric with its corresponding value.
