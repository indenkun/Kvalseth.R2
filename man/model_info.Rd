\title{Get Model Information Used for Calculations}
\usage{
model_info(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{r2_kvr2} or \code{comp_kvr2}.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{type}: A string indicating the regression type ("linear" or "power").
\item \code{has_intercept}: A logical value indicating if the model includes an intercept.
\item \code{n}: The number of observations used in the model (excluding missing values).
\item \code{k}: The number of estimated parameters (including the intercept if present).
\item \code{df_res}: Residual degrees of freedom (\eqn{n - k}).
}
}
\description{
Extracts the metadata and model specifications used to calculate the
coefficients of determination, such as the regression type,
sample size, and degrees of freedom.
}
\details{
This function provides transparency into the calculation process of the
various R-squared definitions. It is particularly useful for verifying
whether a model was treated as a "power" regression (log-transformed)
and how the degrees of freedom were determined for adjusted R-squared values.
}
\note{
The sample size \code{n} refers to the actual number of observations
used by \code{\link[=lm]{lm()}}, which may be fewer than the rows in the original
data frame if \code{NA} values were present.
}
\examples{
df1 <- data.frame(x = 1:6, y = c(15, 37, 52, 59, 83, 92))
model <- lm(y ~ x, data = df1)
res <- r2(model)

# Check the metadata
info <- model_info(res)
info$n
info$type
